/*
1. The `ft_strcmp` function compares the two strings `s1` and `s2`.

2. Cast `s1` and `s2` as unsigned characters and compare them.

3. If the characters differ, return the difference between the unsigned
   chars.

4. If the characters are equal, continue comparing the next characters.

5. If both strings are equal, return 0.


1. The `ft_strncmp` function compares at most `n` characters of the two
   strings `s1` and `s2`.

2. Initialize `i` to 0.

3. Enter a loop that continues while the character at position `i` of
  `s1` and `s2` are not null and `i` is less than `n`.

4. If the characters differ, return the difference between the unsigned chars.

5. If the characters are equal, continue comparing the next characters.

6. If `n` characters are compared and both strings are equal, return 0.

7. If `i` is less than `n` and `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, return the
   difference between the unsigned chars at the `i`th position.

8. If `i` is equal to `n` and all characters are equal, return 0.
